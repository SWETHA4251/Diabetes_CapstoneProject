# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project uses multiple machine learning algorithms to predict whether a patient is diabetic based on diagnostic health measurements. The dataset used is sourced from the **National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases**.

## 🔍 Overview

The aim is to build a classification model that can accurately predict the presence of diabetes using health-related input features. After comparing several algorithms, the **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model showed the best performance.

## 📊 Algorithms Used

- Logistic Regression  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest   
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## ✅ Final Model

- **Best Performing Model:** Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve
